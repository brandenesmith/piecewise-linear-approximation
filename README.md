# piecewiseLinearApproximation
A simple go package to compute piecewise linear approximations of time series data.
Specifically, this package takes a time series data set of points
{(t,y) | t and y are real numbers with t monotonically increasing} and creates a
constraint relation of the data. The package provides a function to produce the
constraint relation table in LaTeX.

# Using the Package
To use this package simply fork the repository to your go workspace then, from the command line,
navigate to `$GOPATH/src/piecewiseLinearApproximation` and run `go install`.

With this completed, navigate to `$GOPATH/src` and create a new directory.
In this directory create, a new file with a main function as shown below.
```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    p "piecewiseLinearApproximation"
)

func main() {
    var timeSeries1 = []p.Pair {
    	p.Pair{0, 0},
    	p.Pair{1, 1},
    	p.Pair{2, 2},
    	p.Pair{3, 3},
    }

    var tollerance float64 = 2

    equations := p.PiecewiseLinearApprox(timeSeries1, tollerance)

    // Output the equations and their intervals to the standard output.
    for i := 0; i < len(equations); i++ {
        fmt.Printf("%s, %g <= t <= %g\n", equations[i].Expression,
        equations[i].Interval.X, equations[i].Interval.Y)
    }

    fmt.Printf("\n\n")

    // Output a latex table to the standard output.
    p.ToLaTeX(equations, "Solution (b)")
}
```
