# piecewiseLinearApproximation
A simple go package to compute piecewise linear approximations of time series data.
Specifically, this package takes a time series data set of points
{(x,y) | x and y are real numbers} and creates a constraint relation of the
data to represent an infinite amount of data in a database.
